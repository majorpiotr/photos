 I am Python , JS and C Sharp developer, but I ready to gain skills in other technologies as well. My great passion are computers , foreign languages and history. Recently I am very fascinated in Cosmos- and this is subject of some projects in my portfolio. Since early childhood I am interested in computers,science and technology. In basic school I have wrote first programs in Turbo Pascal , Basic and small pages in Html/JS and Flash. I graduated technical college (Electronics - Computers Systems and Network) with good results. I have been also member of student council, editor of school radio and newspaper. After school I flew to New Zealand in order to travel and improve my English. I have spend there the most wonderful year in my live. After coming back to my home town - Czestochowa I had problem with finding good job. This is why I made CNC course and become 'CNC machinist and programmer' and have been working in this profession for several years in Germany, Poland and The Netherlands. During this time I improved my skills in English and German attending many courses (most of them online). In the same time I stared building IT projects for my Portfolio and was solving programming problems at codeinwars.com. You can see what have I created in section "My projects".
